This file assumes that you have completed the directions in the
SSH-Setup-Jetson.txt file.

Turn on the Jetson Nano by connecting it to a power supply.
You may have to wait a moment for it to boot.

Connect the Jetson Nano to your PC via an Ethernet Cable. This may require
an adaptor.

Windows Instructions:
Open Settings.
Go to Network & Internet -> Ethernet
One of the ethernet options should say 'Unknown Network' and 'no internet'
Open the dropdown menu for this option.
Take a screenshot of the current settings so that you can revert them later.
Find the line that says 'DNS server assignment' and click the edit button on
the right.
Switch from 'Automatic' to 'Manual'.
Turn on IPv-4

Type in the boxes as they appear:
    In the 'Address' box:        192.168.1.2
    In the 'Subnet Mask' box:    255.255.255.0
    In the 'Gateway' box:        192.168.1.1
    In the 'Preferred DNS' box:  192.168.1.2
Press Save.

Open either 'Command Prompt' or 'Windows Powershell'
To make sure that you are connected to the Jetson Nano, type the command:
    ping 192.168.1.3
You should get back 4 pings, and then some stats about them. If it says
'request timed out', you will need to do some troubleshooting.

Assuming that you get pings back as expected, you are good to attempt to ssh

Type the command:
    ssh motorsport@192.168.1.3
(remember to substitute the name of your account on the Jetson Nano for 'motorsport')

You should be prompted for a password. Enter the password for the account you
set up on the Jetson Nano.
You should see a welcome message, and then have your directory changed to
'motorsport@COMPUTER_NAME~'
You are now connected through ssh to the Jetson Nano.


Linux and Mac to come. (should be quite similar to windows)
