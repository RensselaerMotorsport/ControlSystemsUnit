First follow the instructions at the following website for initial boot:
https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit

Once you have booted the nano, you will need to connect a mouse, keyboard,
and monitor to it.
Create an account and password. In these instructions, I will refer to
'motorsport' as the account name. Whenever you see this, substitute your
own account name.

Next you will need to enter the settings menu, and navigate to network
settings.
In here you will need to determine which connection corresponds to the
ethernet port.
Select the wired connection corresponding to the ethernet port and open
the properties menu.

Navigate to the IPv-4 tab in the properties menu and take a screenshot
of the current settings so that you will be able to reset them if you
need to.
Once you have saved your screenshot somewhere useful, you will need to
change the DNS server assignment from 'Automatic' to 'Manual'.
From here, press the add button next to the three columns that say
'Address', 'Subnet Mask', and 'Gateway'.
Type in the row you have just created:
    In the 'Address' column:        192.168.1.3
    In the 'Subnet Mask' column:    255.255.255.0
    In the 'Gateway' column:        192.168.1.1

Save these settings.
You should now be able to ssh into the nano.
Open the SSH-Setup-PC.txt file for next steps.
